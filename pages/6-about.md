			<h2>Who?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We're five brothers, two parents, and two goldfish. Jack might get a cat. Raised in Minneapolis, MN, we've spread across the midwest like a disease and the CDC simply can't stop us. Our interests vary from biological research to orbital dynamics to standing up static sites about our family. We're not here on <code>the ellenberger zone</code> to give you every little detail, just to give you something to read while you wait for us to review that offer letter you sent over, you know, that one where you wrote "big bucks"?</p>

				<p>JV Champions and thought leaders of the nordic track, the Ellenbergers dominate the long distance, while perfecting the techniques of nordic sleeping. Few can maintain the strict regimens of constant tapering and non-stop dry land training	, and an even slighter number could take those teachings all the way to the Boston Marathon. All the Ellenbergers are active, but not all have learned to be actively inactive.</p>
