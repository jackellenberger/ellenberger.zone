We're five brothers: Matt, Michael, Jack, David, and Mark, raised in Minnesota and currently in various states of gainful employment. Here in <code>The Ellenberger Zone</code> you can get to know us just a bit and direct yourself to our personal sites. There, we'll have more specific contact information, projects we've worked on, and what we're intrested in working on. Give us a look and get in touch! <i>-- Your Middlest Brother Jack<i>
