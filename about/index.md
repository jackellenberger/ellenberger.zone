## Who are  you people??
* Mark
* David
* Jack (me!)
* Michael
* Matt

## But why though?

Look buddy it's a work in progress I just thought I oughta know how to stand up a personal site. I'll make it more better and useful later.

C'mon man someone is squatting .com and Eritrea isn't selling their TLD. If they were you know I'd snap up ellenberg.er.
